# MentalSpace.tech   
##Inspiration.   
We were inspired by this hackathon to create this wonderful project. For this weekend, we had the opportunity to take a break from NC and enjoy this week of hacking with fellow students. With this idea of "break", we wanted to implement this inside our project.   
   
## What it does.   
This is a website that incorporates custom art and the idea of a mental space. You can find current information about Mental Health, enjoy a small game, and explore our attempt to make a small smile on your face.   

## How we built it.   
This website was built on installations of three.js, vite.js node.js, git bash. We were able to incorporate these concepts in the html files and style them with the css. To add, we had to learn how to design 3D objects and add them into our website.   

Also, We incorporated a game titled "Adventure through the stars". This was made by a team member who was so dedicated to learn more about gamemaker and apply it to this project.

We also had to draw all the art and learn concepts of API to apply it to our website. It was also our first time using AWS so that concept was super interesting.  

## Challenges we ran into.  
AWS was a bit rough. Also, mini issues with game maker and using GitHub as a team.  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of.  
Completing a game with an animated character is something super exciting. It was so cool to learn about 3D modeling and use it in our website. We learned AWS for the first time and sang karaoke. We were able to incorporate our passions in this project and it's something we are proud of. We believe that a joke will put a smile on your face and we were able to add that.   

## What we learned   
AWS, 3D-modeling, Game-maker Language, Three.js, Vite.js, Git Bash, and Node.js. We had learn how to publish a website for the first time.   

## What's next for Mental Space  
AWS. We are trying to get it cloud hosted by AWS and it would be very cool.
